## Feedback

Thanks for the clear and thorough write-up. It was nice being able to know what you'd done and in what order. Cool use of the batch processing and smart to put everything in one table. I don't think I've seen students do that before. 

### Task 2

No notes here, this is a sensible way to do everything.

### Task 3

Nice use of `to_sql`. That's definitely the most efficient way to do this.
